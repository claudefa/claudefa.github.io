title: About me
---

I am an **evolutionary biologist** interested in how genomes can help us understand the evolutionary trajectories of populations, particularly focused on those currently endangered so it can mitigate their extinction risk. I consider myself a versatile researcher with formal training in both bioinformatics and wet lab techniques, who can develop a project from sample DNA extraction to the genomic analysis. 

I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at the [Section for Hologenomics at Globe Institute](https://globe.ku.dk/research/hologenomics/) at the University of Copenhagen (Denmark). Here I collaborate with Tom Gilbert, Hernán E. Morales Villegas and Shyam Gopalakrishnan groups mostly focused on genomic dynamics of endangered and extinct populations. 


I did my PhD and first Postdoc at the [Institute of Evolutionary Biology](https://www.ibe.upf-csic.es) (Universitat Pompeu Fabra) in Barcelona (Spain). During this time my research was focus on Great Ape population genomics with particular interest in chimpanzees. I generated the most complete dataset of chimpanzee genomic information expaning the whole extant chimpanzee range using fecal samples and target capture. The main paper of my PhD was published in [Cell Genomics](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.xgen.2022.100133) in 2022
